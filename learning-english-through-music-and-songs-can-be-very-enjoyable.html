                                            A. Reading LEARNING ENGLISH THROUGH MUSIC AND SONGSLearning English through music and songs can be very enjoyable. You can mix pleasure with learning when you listen to a song and exploit the song as means to your English progress. Some underlying reason can be drawn to support the idea why we used songs in language learning.Firstly, “ The song stuck in my head”, phenomenon ( the echoing your minds of the last song we heard after leaving a restaurant, shopping mall, etc) can be both enjoyable and sometimes unnerving. This phenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that song work on your shot and long term memory.Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversation language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically, lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary sample.Furthermore, songs can be appropriate by listeners for their own purpose. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place, or time references.In addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism, and yes, even revolutions.Last but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs, such as studying grammar, practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary and studying the culture.Thus, from the elaboration above, it can be concluded that by learning through music and songs, learning English can be enjoyable, and it is fun to learn English.1.       The pronoun “their” in paragraph 4 refers to ….​</a>

You can mix pleasure with learning when you listen to a song and exploit the song as a means to your English progress. Some underlying reason can be drawn to support the idea why we use songs in language learning.Firstly, “the song stuck in my head” Phenomenon (the echoing in our minds of the last song we heard after leaving a restaurant, shopping malls, etc) can be both enjoyable and sometimes unnerving. This phenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that songs work on our short-and-long term memory.Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text. The fact that they are effective makes them many times more motivating than other text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically, lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary sample.Furthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purpose. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time reference.In addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group.

Learning English through music and songs can be very enjoyable. You can mix pleasure with learning when you listen to a song and exploit the song as a means to your English progress. Some underlying reason can be drawn to support the idea why we use songs in language learning. Firstly, "the song stuck in my head" Phenomenon (the echoing in our minds of the last song we heard after leaving a restaurant, shopping malls, etc) can be both enjoyable and sometimes unnerving. This phenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that songs work on our short-and-long term memory. Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text. The fact that they are effective makes them many times more motivating than other text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically, lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary sample. Furthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purpose. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time reference. In addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism and yeas, even revolution. Last but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs such as studying grammar, practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary, spelling and culture. From the elaboration above, it can be concluded that learning through music and songs, learning English can be enjoyable and fun

Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text.

They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism and yeas, even revolution.     Last but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs such as studying grammar, practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary, spelling and culture.From the elaboration above, it can be concluded that learning through music and songs, learning English can be enjoyable and fun.5.

Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time reference. In addition, songs are relaxing.

Fenomena ini juga tampaknya memperkuat gagasan bahwa lagu bekerja pada ingatan jangka pendek dan jangka panjang kita.</p><p></p><p>Kedua, lagu pada umumnya juga menggunakan bahasa percakapan sederhana, dengan banyak pengulangan, itulah yang dicari oleh banyak pelajar untuk contoh teks.

Meskipun biasanya sederhana, beberapa lagu dapat menjadi sangat kompleks secara sintaksis, leksikal dan puitis, dan dapat dianalisis dengan cara yang sama seperti sampel sastra lainnya.</p><p></p><p>Lagipula, lagu dapat disesuaikan oleh pendengar untuk kepentingannya sendiri.

Tidak heran mereka adalah alat penting dalam melestarikan budaya, agama, patriotisme, dan yeas, bahkan revolusi.</p><p></p><p>Last but not least, ada banyak kegiatan belajar yang bisa kita lakukan dengan lagu seperti belajar tata bahasa, berlatih pemahaman mendengar selektif, menerjemahkan lagu, belajar kosakata, ejaan dan budaya.</p><p></p><p>Dari uraian di atas, dapat disimpulkan bahwa belajar melalui musik dan lagu, belajar bahasa Inggris bisa menyenangkan dan menyenangkan</p><p>Maaf kalo salah</p><p></p><br />

Learning English through music and songs can be very enjoyable. You can mix pleasure with learning when you listen to a song and exploit the song as a means to your English progress. Some underlying reason can be drawn to support the idea why we use songs in language learning. Firstly, "the song stuck in my head" Phenomenon (the echoing in our minds of the last song we heard after leaving a restaurant, shopping malls, etc) can be both enjoyable and sometimes unnerving. This phenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that songs work on our short-and-long term memory. Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is just what many learners look for sample text. The fact that they are effective makes them many times more motivating than other text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically, lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary sample. Furthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purpose. Most pop songs and probably many other types don’t have precise people, place or time reference. In addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself and within one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism and yeas, even revolution. Last but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs such as studying grammar, practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary, spelling and culture. From the elaboration above, it can be concluded that learning through music and songs, learning English can be enjoyable and fun

                            29. Learning English through music and songs can be very enjoyable. You can mix pleasure with learningwhen you listen to a song and exploit the song as a means to your English progress. Some underlyingreason can be drawn to support the idea why we use songs in language learning.Firstly, "the song stuck in my head" Phenomenon (the echoing in our minds of the last song we heardafter leaving a restaurant, shopping malls, etc) can be both enjoyable and sometimes unnerving. Thisphenomenon also seems to reinforce the idea that songs work on our short-and-long term memory.Secondly, songs in general also use simple conversational language, with a lot of repetition, which is justwhat many learners look for sample text. The fact that they are effective makes them many times moremotivating than other text. Although usually simple, some songs can be quite complex syntactically,lexically and poetically, and can be analyzed in the same way as any other literary sample.Furthermore, song can be appropriated by listener for their own purpose. Most pop songs and probablymany other types don't have precise people, place or time reference.In addition, songs are relaxing. They provide variety and fun, and encourage harmony within oneself andwithin one group. Little wonder they are important tools in sustaining culture, religion, patriotism andyeas, even revolution.Last but not least, there are many learning activities we can do with songs such as studying grammar,practicing selective listening comprehension, translating songs, learning vocabulary, spelling and culture.From the elaboration above, it can be concluded that learning through music and songs, learning Englishcan be enjoyable and fun.1.The type of the text above?2.
