They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.</p><p></p><p>The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, "Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?" The other friend replied, "Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend."</p><p></p><p>Moral of the Story- A true friend in need is a friend indeed.</p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>SMG MBMT :) </p><p></p><br />

 volunteered to become the king's next meal.<br />
Ajisaka went directly to the king's palace.“I am willing to be your next
 meal. Your Highnees. However, I have a request.“ said Aji Saka to the 
king. “Whatever you please, young man, I will grant your request,“ the 
king replied. “Before you eat me, grant me some land. Just enough length
 of my own headcloth.“ continued Aji Saka. “Come, Young Man. Let's 
measure your headcloth so that I can have my meal and you can have your 
land“ agreed the king.<br />
Ajisaka began to unwrap the cloth tied around his head. The king got 
down from his throne and hold one end of the headcloth. He stepped 
backward. What he didn't know was that this headcloth was much longer.

                        Contohnya :<br /><br />The Ugly Duckling<br />oleh Hans Cristian Andersen<br /><br />One upon time, a mother duck sat on her eggs. She felt tired of sitting on them. She just wished the eggs would break out.<br /><br />Several days later, she got her wish. The eggs cracked and some cute little ducklings appeared. "Peep, peep" the little ducklings cried. "Quack, quack" their mother greeted in return.<br /><br />However the largest egg had not cracked. The mother duck sat on it for several days. Finally, it cracked and a huge ugly duckling waddled out. The mother duck looked at him in surprise. He was so big and very gray. He didn't look like the others at all. He was like a turkey.<br /><br />When the mother duck brought the children to the pond for their first swimming lesson., the huge grey duckling splashed and paddled about just as nicely as the other ducklings did. "That is not a turkey chick. He is my very own son and quite handsome" the mother said proudly.<br /><br />However, the other animals didn't agree. They hissed and made fun of him day by day. Even his own sisters and brothers were very unkind. "You are very ugly" they quacked.<br /><br />The little poor duckling was very unhappy. "I wish I looked like them" he thought to himself. One day, the ugly duckling run away and hid in the bushes. The sad duckling lived alone through the cold and snow winter. Finally the spring flowers began to bloom. While he was swimming in the pond, he saw three large white swans swimming toward him. "Oh, dear. these beautiful birds will laugh and peck me too" he said to himself. But the swans did not attack him. Instead, they swam around him and stroked him with their bills. As the ugly duckling bent his neck to speak to them, he saw his reflection in the water. He could not believe his eyes. "I am not an ugly duckling but a beautiful swam" he exclaimed.<br /><br />He was very happy. From that day on, he swam and played with his new friends and was happier than he had never been.<br />

                        Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Cinderella. She lived with her step mother and two step sisters. The step mother and sisters were conceited and bad tempered. They treated Cinderella very badly. Her step mother made Cinderella do the hardest works in the house; such as scrubbing the floor, cleaning the pot and pan and preparing the food for the family. The two step sisters, on the other hand, did not work about the house. Their mother gave them many handsome dresses to wear. One day, the two step sister received an invitation to the ball that the king’s son was going to give at the palace. They were excited about this and spent so much time choosing the dresses they would wear. At last, the day of the ball came, and away went the sisters to it. Cinderella could not help crying after they had left. “Why are crying, Cinderella?” a voice asked. She looked up and saw her fairy godmother standing beside her, “because I want so much to go to the ball” said Cinderella. “Well” said the godmother,”you’ve been such a cheerful, hardworking, uncomplaining girl that I am going to see that you do go to the ball”. Magically, the fairy godmother changed a pumpkin into a fine coach and mice into a coachman and two footmen. Her godmother tapped Cinderella’s raged dress with her wand, and it became a beautiful ball gown. Then she gave her a pair of pretty glass slippers. “Now, Cinderella”, she said; “You must leave before midnight”. Then away she drove in her beautiful coach. Cinderella was having a wonderfully good time. She danced again and again with the king’s son. Suddenly the clock began to strike twelve, she ran toward the door as quickly as she could. In her hurry, one of her glass slipper was left behind. A few days later, the king’ son proclaimed that he would marry the girl whose feet fitted the glass slipper. Her step sisters tried on the slipper but it was too small for them, no matter how hard they squeezed their toes into it. In the end, the king’s page let Cinderella try on the slipper. She stuck out her foot and the page slipped the slipper on. It fitted perfectly. Finally, she was driven to the palace. The king’s son was overjoyed to see her again. They were married and live happily ever after.<br />

Once
 upon a  time, there lived an unhappy young girl with her stepmother and
 two step sisters who didn't like her. All the nice things, kind thought
 and loving touches were for her own daughters. But, for the poor 
unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. For she had to work hard all 
day, and only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a while by 
the fire, near the cinders. That is how she got her nickname, for 
everybody called her Cinderella.<br /><br />
It
 was quite true. Cinderella, even dressed in rags with a dusty gray face
 from the cinders, was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter 
how splendid and elegant their clothes, were still clumsy, lumpy, and 
ugly.<br /><br />
One
 day, a ball was to be held by the royal family of the kingdom to find 
the prince's spouse. Cinderella's stepsisters ordered beautiful new 
dress for the ball. Cinderella wanted to go to the ball but her 
stepmother asked her to stay at home.<br /><br />
"You?
 My dear girl, you're staying at home to wash the dishes, scrub the 
floor and turn down the beds for your stepsisters. They will come home 
tired and very sleepy." asked her stepmother.<br /><br />
Cinderella
 only nodded her head and began to work. Suddenly something amazing 
happened. In the kitchen, where Cinderella was sitting all by herself, 
there was a burst of light and a fairy appeared.<br /><br />
"Don't be afraid Cinderella, I know what you feel, my dear. Do you want to go to ball?" asked the fairy.<br /><br />
"Yes, I do. But look! How can I go to the ball with this dress? Cinderella replied.<br /><br />
Then
 the fairy turned Cinderella's dress became the most beautiful dress and
 with beautiful slippers, the loveliest ever seen in the realm. The 
fairy also turned a pumpkin into a parking coach and turned the mice 
become six white horses.<br /><br />
"Now,
 you can go to the Court and go to the ball. But remember my dear 
Cinderella, you must leave the ball at midnight and come home. For that 
is when the spell ends. Your coach will turn back into a pumpkin, the 
horses will become mice and you will be dressed again in rags with 
clogs.<br /><br />
At
 the ballroom, Cinderella amazed everybody there include the prince. 
When the prince set eyes on Cinderella, he was stuck by her beauty. 
Walking over to her, he bowed deeply and asked her to dance. Cinderella 
had a wonderful time at the ball. But, all of a sudden, she heard the 
sound of a clock, the first stroke of midnight.<br /><br />
Remembered
 what the fairy had said, Cinderella ran back to the coach and went 
home. But he lost one of her slippers in ballroom. The prince who was 
now madly in love with her, picked up her slipper and would search for 
the girl whose foot fitted with the slipper.<br /><br />
In
 the next morning, the prince began to search everywhere in the kingdom 
but no girl whose foot fitted with the slipper. Until he found 
Cinderella house and asked Cinderella's stepsisters to wear the slipper.
 But none fitted with the slipper. The prince began hopeless.<br /><br />
"Is there any girl else here" Asked the prince.<br /><br />
"Yes,
 there are. But she is very ugly and I think she is not the girl that 
you are looking for." replied Cinderella's stepmother.<br /><br />
"Call her here!" Asked the prince.<br /><br />
Then
 Cinderella's stepmother called Cinderella to come out who was dressed 
in rags and wore clogs like usual. The prince began to wear the slipper 
into Cinderella foot, and it was fit.<br /><br />
The
 prince believed that Cinderella was the girl he met in the ball. Then 
the prince asked Cinderella to marry him. And at the end, Cinderella and
 the prince lived happily ever after in the kingdom.<br /><br /><br />questions:<br /><br />1. How can she got the 'cinderella' nickname?<br />Bcs she had to work hard all 
day, and only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a while by
